# **Node.js + TypeScript Boilerplate**

A reusable template for building Node.js projects with TypeScript. This boilerplate is pre-configured with essential tools to help you get started quickly and focus on building your application.

---

## **Features**
- ðŸš€ **Pre-configured TypeScript** for modern JavaScript development.
- ðŸ”„ **Nodemon** for seamless development with hot-reloading.
- ðŸ“‚ Organized and **ready-to-use directory structure** for scalable projects.
- ðŸŒŸ Includes scripts for building, development, and production.

---

## **How to Use**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Clone the boilerplate to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ams-sth/typescript-node-template.git
cd typescript-node-template

NOTE: Delete the hidden .git folder after cloning to remove the original repository link, then add your own GitHub repository link as the remote.. 
```

---

### **2. Rename the Project**
Update the `name` and other metadata in `package.json`:
- Open `package.json` and edit the `name` field:
  ```json
  "name": "your-new-project-name"
  ```
- Optionally, update the `description`, `author`, and `license` fields.

---

### **3. Install and Manage Dependencies**
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all required dependencies as defined in your `package.json`:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Check for Outdated Packages**:
   To check which packages are outdated, run:
   ```bash
   npm outdated
   ```

3. **Update Dependencies**:
   - To update dependencies **within the current version ranges** defined in your `package.json`, run:
     ```bash
     npm update

     NOTE: This will not modify the version ranges in package.json, only the installed packages in node_modules.
     ```
    **OPTIONALLY**:
   - To **upgrade** your dependencies to the latest versions (even if they fall outside the version ranges in `package.json`), use:
     ```bash
     npx npm-check-updates -u
     npm install

     NOTE: npx npm-check-updates -u updates both the installed packages and the version ranges in package.json to the latest versions.
     ```

## **Production**

### **1. Start the Development Server**
Run the server in development mode with hot-reloading:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### **2. Build for Production**
Compile TypeScript files into JavaScript:
```bash
npm run build
```

---

### **6. Run the Production Build**
Run the production-ready application:
```bash
npm start
```
